# BetterCrashes

BetterCrashes is a port of VanillaFix's crash improvement features to Minecraft 1.7.10.

BetterCrashes makes Minecraft return you to the main menu when it crashes,and it can upload your Crash-Report to
[Ubuntu Pastebin](http://paste.ubuntu.com/) for send the link easier.

Most of the code comes from VanillaFix, I just make them work on Minecraft 1.7.10.

Requires [SpongeMixins](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/SpongeMixins) mod to work
