# BetterCrashes

BetterCrashes is a port of VanillaFix's crash improvement features to Minecraft 1.7.10.

BetterCrashes makes Minecraft return you to the main menu when it crashes, and it can upload your crash report to
[mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/) for easy sharing.

Most of the code comes from VanillaFix, I just made it work on Minecraft 1.7.10.

Requires [SpongeMixins](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/SpongeMixins) mod to work
